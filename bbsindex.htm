Note:
<ul>
  <li>"Flip Side" ( 裏 ) is a literal translation and means
something like "perverted" but can also be understood as "weird",
"random" or "other". It's basically used to indicate boards where
pictures get uploaded that normally would not or should not be uploaded
to their main counterparts. </li>
  <li>"NETA" ( ネタ ) also has more than one kind of meaning. It can mean
"meme", but
also "spoof", news (or gag) material, stories you make up or any sorts
of funny photoshops. </li>
  <li>On why there are <s>three four five SIX</s> SEVEN! Nijiura boards:<br>

<p><b>0.57:</b> Added boards for the Tohoku earthquake and power plants.  Thanks to Charles for the info.
<p><b>0.56:</b> Added Idle Chat and Aquatic Life.
<p><b>0.55:</b> I'm not dead!  Several updates.
</p><p><b>0.54:</b> NEW AND/OR RETURNING BOARDS: Mahjong, Trouble 
Consultation, Net Characters, Military and Military - Flipside, and 
Touhou.  Dead text boards:  Lounge, Anime.  And now there are only two 
text boards left:  ASCII Art and Shopping.  Who knows when they'll bite 
the dust...  
</p><p><b>0.53:</b> NEW PAGES:  Bicycles, Nijiura ID, Narikiri, 
Politics, Economics, Korean Economics.  Dead pages purged.  More 
accurate translations of board names.
</p><p><b>0.52:</b> THE REVENGE OF THE FUJOSHI:  The Yaoi board is back 
from the dead, and there is now a Josou (a subgenre of shotacon 
involving crossdressing boys) board.</p>
<p><b>0.51a:</b> A kind anonymous on /soc/ informed me of the sixth known Nijiura board on the cgi server.</p>
<p><b>0.51:</b> bluethree.us has moved twice in two days.  The old 
server, on which I was given free space for the Navigator, went belly-up
 due to financial constraints, and I was forced to put bluethree on 
godaddy's free server.  However, the banner ad at the top was simply too
 invasive, and it didn't take long for a user of the Navigator to offer 
free space with no strings attached.  Thanks for your generosity, 
Storlek!</p>
<p>As long as I was moving everything again, I figured I should do an 
update or two.  First of all, there's the introduction to Futaba 
Channel, a quick intro and guide to the boards of Futaba.  Don't just 
dive head-first into a board before you know what you're getting into!  
Second, I cleaned up more dead boards.  More updates to come on an 
as-needed basis.</p><p>
</p><p><b>0.50:</b> A complete rewrite of the menu took place on
January 4, 2008. Ordinary K !3GqYIJ3Obs translated the latest frame
menu from Futaba Channel, including known hidden boards, removing
several dead boards, especially in the text board section. (Anybody
want to explain why the text board section was cut down so severely?
Redundancy with 2ch, perhaps?)</p>
<p>Have a suggestion for a better translation of a board name? Did I
make a mistake? (One has already been found and fixed, thanks Waha!) <a href="mailto:OrdinaryK@gmail.com"> E-mail me.</a></p>
